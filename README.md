# BCSSA-Registrar
Registrar is for signing up for competitions, in a simple format. 
## Purpose
As the Athlete Development Committee  and official Recorders look to standardize the inter-club format province-wide, we will be splitting skaters into 'groups' similar to divisions in inter-clubs today, based upon seed times, age and requests for skaters to skate up/down divisions. A sorted list of skaters for each competition will be available for download from this tool.
## Installation
BCSSA Registrar requires both the source material, and a MySQL database connection.
